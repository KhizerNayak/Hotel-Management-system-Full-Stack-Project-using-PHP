# HOTEL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-
Manage your hotel efficiently with our PHP-based Hotel Management System. This system streamlines check-in, room bookings, and real-time room status updates, making it easy for customers and staff. It's user-friendly, expandable, and built on the robust XAMPP platform. Your guests deserve the best, our system helps you deliver it.

This project is a hotel management system that automates the major hotel operations such as generating COD, bills, and item details to the customer. It also provides services to customers like booking (advance/current), cancellation of advance booking, enquiring about any customer (by name/customerId) or about room availability. The project has scope in hotels since the routine activities of managing departments become easy.
